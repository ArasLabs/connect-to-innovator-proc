# Start New or Connect to Existing Innovator from Another Process

The attached VS 2008 project is a sample that demonstrates how to either start a new Innovator IE client or connect to already running Innovator IE client from another process and execute an arbitrary JavaScript in it (for instance, open a tear-off window with form for a particular item).

The technique could be used in various integration scenarios with Innovator.

Note that Version 1 of the project supported only starting a new Innovator client and worked with releases 8.1-9.1 SP4 of Innovator.

Version 2 of the project supports both starting a new Innovator and connecting to already running one. Version 3 fix some problems and works with 9.1 SP5 and higher versions of Innovator.
